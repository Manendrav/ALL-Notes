# Strings üí¨

In programming, a string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. Strings are a fundamental data type in most programming languages.

Examples of string literals: "Hello", "world", "123".
Examples of string variables: 'name', 'message', 'text'.

### Character Array

A character array, often called a C-string, is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by a null character ('\0').

Examples of character arrays: 
        char str[10]; 
        char name[] = "John"; 
        char message[100];

## Types Of Strings üìù

1. **_Immutable Strings_**:
   Immutable strings are strings whose contents cannot be changed after they are created. This means that once a string object is created, its value cannot be modified.

   - Instead, any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string with the desired changes.

2. **_Mutable Strings_**:
   Mutable strings, on the other hand, allow their contents to be modified after they are created. This means that you can directly change individual characters or substrings within a mutable string without creating a new string object.
   - Can be more memory-efficient for certain operations, as they avoid creating new string objects.

## Substring Extration

Substring extraction refers to the process of obtaining a portion of a string, known as a substring, from a larger string. It involves selecting a contiguous sequence of characters from the original string based on specified indices or conditions.

**Substring extraction is a common operation in programming:**

1.  **Text Processing**: Extracting specific information or patterns from textual data.

2.  **Data Manipulation**: Manipulating and transforming strings based on certain criteria.

3.  **Search and Replace**: Finding occurrences of substrings within a larger string and replacing them with other substrings.

4.  **Parsing**: Breaking down complex strings into smaller, more manageable parts for analysis or processing.

```

**Q3) Swap Characters:**  
 Implement a function that takes a string and two indices as input, swaps the characters at the specified indices, and returns the modified string.

```bash
  input_string = "Hello"
  two indices 1 and 3
  Output:  ['H', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'o'].
```

**Q4) Implement String Concatenation:**  
 Write a function to concatenate two strings without using any built-in string concatenation functions or operators.

```bash
  str1 = "Hello"
  str2 = "World"
  Output:  "HelloWorld".
```

**Q5) Reverse Concatenated String:**  
 Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in every word within the string, while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

```bash
   input_string = "Let's code today"
   Output:  "s'teL edoc yadot".
```

**Q6) First N Characters:**  
 Write a program that takes a string and an integer n as input and prints the first n characters of the string.

```bash
   input_string = "Hello, World!"   n: 7
   Output:  "Hello,"
```

**Q7) Extract Substring:**  
 Create a program that takes a string and two integers start and end as input and prints the substring of the string from index start to index end.

```bash
  String: "Hello, World!"
  start: 7
  end: 11
  Output:  "World"
```

**Q8) Every Nth Character:**  
 Write a function that takes a string and an integer n as input and prints every nth character of the string.

```bash
  String: "Hello, World!"
  n: 3
  3rd position: l, ',' , o, d
```

**Q9) Remove Prefix:**  
 Write a function that takes a string and another string prefix as input and removes the prefix from the beginning of the string if it exists.

```bash
  str = "hello world"
  prefix = "hello "
  Output:  "World"
```

**10) Extract Word:**  
 Implement a function that takes a sentence and an integer index as input and prints the word at the specified index in the sentence.

```bash
  Sentence: "This is a sample sentence"
  Index: 3
  Output:  "sample"
```

### Case Conversion

**11) Convert to Uppercase:**  
 Write a program that takes a string as input and converts all characters to uppercase. (same for other cases)

```bash
  Input:  "Hello, World!"
  Output: "HELLO, WORLD!"
```

**12) Toggle Case:**  
  Create a program that takes a string as input and toggles the case of each character (converts uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa)

```bash
  Input:  "Hello, World!"
  Output: "hELLO, wORLD!"
```

**13) Convert to Uppercase First Letter:**  
  Write a program that takes a string as input and converts the first letter of the string to uppercase while keeping the rest of the string unchanged.

```bash
  Input:  "hello, world!"
  Output: "Hello, world!"
```

**14) Reverse Case Conversion:**  
   Write a function that takes a string as input and converts uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa, while also reversing the order of the characters in the string.

```bash
  Input:  "Hello, World!"
  Output: "!DLROw ,OLLEh".
```

### Trimming

**15) Remove Leading and Trailing Whitespaces:**  
  Write a program that takes a string as input and removes any leading and trailing whitespace characters. (remove space form front and end only).

```bash
  Input:  " Hello, World! "
  Output: "Hello, World!"
```

**16) Trim Specific Character:**  
  Write a function that takes a string and a specific character as input, and removes all occurrences of that character from both the beginning and end of the string.

```bash
  Input:  "***Hello, World!***", '*'
  Output: "Hello, World!"
```

**17) Remove Specific Characters:**  
   Write a function that takes a string as input, and removes all the character between A-Z, a-z and 0-9

```bash
  Input:  "Hello, World!"
  Output: ", !"
```



## Intermediate Questions

**1) CamelCase to Snake Case:**  
   Create a program that takes a string in CamelCase format as input and converts it to snake_case format.

```bash
  Input: "CamelCaseString"
  Output: "camel_case_string"
```

**2) Conditional Case Conversion:**  
   Create a function that takes a string as input and converts uppercase letters to lowercase if they occur at odd indices in the string, and converts lowercase letters to uppercase if they occur at even indices

```bash
  Input:  "Hello, World!"
  Output: "HeLlO, wOrLd!"
```

**3) Remove Prefix:**  
   Implement a program that takes a string and another string as input, and removes the specified prefix from the beginning of the string if it exists. (same do for suffix)

```bash
  Input:  "apple" 
  prefix = "app"
  Output: "le"

  Input = "banana"
  prefix = "app"
