# Strings üí¨

In programming, a string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. Strings are a fundamental data type in most programming languages.

## Types Of Strings üìù

1. ***Immutable Strings***:
   Immutable strings are strings whose contents cannot be changed after they are created. This means that once a string object is created, its value cannot be modified. 
   - Instead, any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string with the desired changes.
    

2. ***Mutable Strings***:
   Mutable strings, on the other hand, allow their contents to be modified after they are created. This means that you can directly change individual characters or substrings within a mutable string without creating a new string object. 
   - Can be more memory-efficient for certain operations, as they avoid creating new string objects.

# Questions

## Basic Questions

**Q1) Perform given operations:** 
   1. **Add a character at specific location**  
   2. **Remove a character at specific location**

**Q2) Repeated Concatenation:**  
   Create a program that takes a string and a number 'n' as input and prints the string concatenated 'n' times.
   ```bash
      input_string = "Hello"
      n = 3
      Output:  "HelloHelloHello"
  ```

**Q3) Swap Characters:**  
   Implement a function that takes a string and two indices as input, swaps the characters at the specified indices, and returns the modified string.
   ```bash
     input_string = "Hello"
     two indices 1 and 3
     Output:  ['H', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'o'].
   ```

**Q4) Implement String Concatenation:**  
   Write a function to concatenate two strings without using any built-in string concatenation functions or operators.
   ```bash
     str1 = "Hello"
     str2 = "World"
     Output:  "HelloWorld".
   ```
   

**Q5) Reverse Concatenated String:**  
   Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in every word within the string, while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
   ```bash
      input_string = "Let's code today"
      Output:  "s'teL edoc yadot".
   ```
