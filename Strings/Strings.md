## Strings

In programming, a string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. Strings are a fundamental data type in most programming languages

# Types Of Strings

1. Immutable Strings: Immutable strings are strings whose contents cannot be changed after they are created. This means that once a string object is created, its value cannot be modified. 
- Instead, any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string with the desired changes

2. Mutable Strings: Mutable strings, on the other hand, allow their contents to be modified after they are created. This means that you can directly change individual characters or substrings within a mutable string without creating a new string object. 
- Can be more memory-efficient for certain operations, as they avoid creating new string objects.
